    "\n",
    "The 'score_deck' function takes in three strings: the 'deck', the player 1 sequence 'seq1', and the player 2 sequence 'seq2'. It initializes the counts for both players' cards and tricks and creates an empty list for the pile. The code iterates through the deck using the index 'k.' The 'sequence' variable slides through the deck 3 cards at a time looking for a match. If a match is not found, the first card of the sequence, k, is added to the pile. If a match is found the player's respective trick count ('p1_tricks' and 'p2_tricks') is incremented by 1, and in terms of card amount, the winner recieves the number of unmatched \"cards\" in current_pile, plus three additional \"cards\" for the matching sequence (added to'p1_cards' and 'p2_cards' respectively). Additionally, the 'current_pile' becomes an empty list again to simulate the empty card pile. This loop continues until all of the 'deck' has been searched through. It then returns the final counts for each players' cards and tricks. "
